        <h2>About Tyson Fury</h2>
        <p>
          Tyson Luke Fury (born 12 August 1988) is a British professional boxer.
          He is a two-time world heavyweight champion, having held the WBC and
          The Ring magazine titles since defeating Deontay Wilder in 2020;
          previously he held the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO, and The
          Ring titles after defeating Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. With his
          defeat of Wilder, Fury became the third heavyweight, after Floyd
          Patterson and Muhammad Ali, to hold The Ring magazine title twice, and
          is widely considered by media outlets to be the lineal heavyweight
          champion.
